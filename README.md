# Randomness Challenge

It is website to see how random you can be while pressing 6 perfectly identical buttons. It also shows data of how many times each button was pressed cumulatively, everytime the website was used. Made using React, NodeJS and ExpressJS.


#### Challenge Description
Try and press the 6 buttons here randomly for some number of times and in the end see your results to see how unbiased and random your choices were. Remember if you try to press a different button from the previous one to make your clicks for every button the same then you are being the opposite of random! The more number of presses you have, the more prominently you can see your bias.
